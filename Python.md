 # Quantum Mechanics
 
 I would like to teach basic science through some Python based visuvalizations techniques for School and College Students 
```
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(1,100,100)
y = np. sin(x)

plt.plot (x,y,'-r)
plt.title(' sine wave generation')
plt.xlabel('Time(s)')
plt.ylabel('Amplitude(Volt)')
```
