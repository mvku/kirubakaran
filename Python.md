# Quantum Physics Visualization with Python Code

 On this blog, I would like to explain the concepts of Quantum Phyics for college level students to understand very hard core Qunatum mechnanics in a very simple way of approach
```
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(1,100,100)
y = np. sin(x)

plt.plot (x,y,'-r)
plt.title(' sine wave generation')
plt.xlabel('Time(s)')
plt.ylabel('Amplitude(Volt)')
```
